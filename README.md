# Bits and Pieces


Bits and pieces is a proposed international shorthand  standard to identify key base ingredients in prepared food. The goal is to capture dietry restrictions related to allergies, religious beliefs, and/or personal preference into a common standard which can be decoded quickly by memorization or using a decoder.

## Examples

In the quarter poudner with cheese, McDonald's uses a Beef Hamburger Patty, American Cheese, Sesame Bun, Ketchup, Pickles, Onions, Mustard


Using the standard, the following string would result


```` B/ Br-S + C-p Ch-a ++ On Ke Mu````



````
B/ - indicates Beef as a main ingredient
Br-S indicates Bread topped with Sesame
+ indicates minor ingredients to follow
C-p indicates cucumber, Pickles
Ch-A indicates cheese, American
On, Ke and Mu are top level groups and applied in very small quantities
````

In the next example, a restaurant serves a beef kebab skewer. The beef is Halal. The following would apply
''''
Ha=B/++p
''''
''''
Ha= Indicates food is Halal
B/ indicates Beef as a main ingredient
++p indicates black pepper was used in very small quantities
''''
